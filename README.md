# Image-Sharpening-using-Knowledge-Distillation
This project aims to enhance image clarity using a lightweight AI model designed for real-time video conferencing scenarios. A high-capacity teacher model (DnCNN) is used to distill knowledge into a compact student model, achieving high performance while maintaining fast inference.
